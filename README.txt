The green tiles show the possible moves. If a player needs to pass, click the pass button(this applies also when the Ai needs to pass).

I did not delete the JavaFx files, I am sorry but I wanted to be sure that I had a functioning jar and I did not wanted to delete accidentally a file.

The AÄ± is also included in the OthelloFX3 jar which can be found in OthelloKI


Picture 1 is a screenshot that I took at 09.12.2021 with the final version of the AI.



Thank you for reading.
